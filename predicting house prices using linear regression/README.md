# 🏠 House Price Prediction (Linear Regression)

This project predicts house prices based on multiple input features such as:
- Area (in square feet)
- BHK (Bedroom count)
- Age of the property (in years)
- Furnished status (1 = Yes, 0 = No)

The model is built using `LinearRegression` from scikit-learn and allows the user to input values dynamically to get a price prediction.
