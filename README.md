# 🏠 House Price Prediction using Linear Regression

This project predicts residential property prices using a Linear Regression model trained on key house features. The model takes user input at runtime and returns a clean price estimate without decimals.

## 🎯 Objective

Build a simple and usable ML model that can:
- Learn from structured housing data
- Accept user inputs (Area, BHK, Age, Furnished)
- Predict the final house price instantly
- Output clean, realistic integer values
